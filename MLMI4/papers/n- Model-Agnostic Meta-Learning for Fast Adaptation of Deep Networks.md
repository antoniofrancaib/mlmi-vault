Second-order derivatives: Investigate **efficient approximations** (e.g., first-order MAML variants) or develop **implicit gradient methods** that reduce computational overhead while preserving performance.

do you train the model param $\theta$ by showing all the tasks? 

**Domain Extension and Benchmarking:**  Apply MAML to additional domains or datasets (e.g., few-shot image segmentation, text classification, or time series forecasting) to test its robustness. This can be paired with a comparative study against other meta-learning methods (like Reptile or meta-SGD) to benchmark performance.
