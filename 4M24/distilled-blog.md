monte-carlo: prove: use MGFs to see MC is normally distributed, unbiased and with variance reducing as 1/N 
-> variance reduction: 
	importance sampling: definition and prove optimal choice q 
	control variates: definition and prove optimal choice c, and thus the optimal variance obtained - same for multivariate case

Riemann Integrals challenges -> why Lebesgue Integral (define it) solves these problems 
Lebesgue Integral - Measure Theory Foundations - RK Derivative 

5-6 
Transition Operator: irreducible, aperiodic, reversible (DB)
prove reversible is sufficient condition 
prove MH transition operator is reversible -> get invariant distribution
prove product kernel works + weighted sum of kernels is invariant 
prove gibbs sampling acceptance is 1

not many proofs, just concepts on different spaces
