1. 
For a generic transition kernel of the form $P(x, d y) = p(x, y) d y + r(x) \delta_x(d y)$

(i) State the conditions on $p(x, y)$ that need to be satisfied for $\pi(\cdot)$ to be the invariant density of $P(x, \cdot)$ and define the form of $r(x)$. 

(ii) Prove that $\pi(\cdot)$ is the invariant density of $P(x, \cdot)$ under the conditions satisfied above.
